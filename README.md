> Need Norwegian stop words for SearchWP? I have [a plugin that adds them](https://github.com/soderlind/norwegian-stopwords-searchwp4)

# Autoactivate SearchWP default Index

This plugin will autoactivate SearchWP default index when the SearchWP plugin is activated. The plugin emulates the "Save" button on the SearchWP Engines tab.

I use this on a multisite installation where I automatically activate SearchWP on new sites, and I want the default index to be active whitout any manual intervention.

# Prerequisites

- [SearchWP](https://searchwp.com/)
- Define til SearchWP license key in wp-config.php
  ```php
  define( 'SEARCHWP_LICENSE_KEY', 'your license key' ); // On a multisite you need an agency license.
  ```

# Installation

1. Download the plugin
2. Upload the plugin to the must use plugins directory, usually `/wp-content/mu-plugins/`
